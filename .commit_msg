M-9: Pre-mainnet deep audit — arithmetic safety + Ed25519 gating + genesis fix

RUST HARDENING (14 saturating arithmetic fixes):
- crates/los-core/src/lib.rs: 5 fixes — Mint/Receive balance credits and
  fee accumulations converted from raw + to saturating_add()/saturating_sub()
- crates/los-node/src/main.rs: 8 fixes — total_debit calc, fee accumulations,
  and balance credits converted to saturating_add()
- All debit operations (4 locations) already safe: guarded by balance checks

GENESIS TIMESTAMP FIX (defense-in-depth):
- Removed stale fallback timestamp unwrap_or(1_770_580_908) in main.rs:4930
- Now stores genesis_timestamp from validated GenesisConfig during startup
- Eliminates redundant file re-read and TOCTOU race condition
- Fatal exit if timestamp missing after validation (should never trigger)

FLUTTER WALLET Ed25519 GATING (2 fixes):
- wallet_service.dart: deriveAddressFromMnemonic() now throws on mainnet
  "MAINNET SECURITY: Ed25519 address derivation is forbidden on mainnet"
- account_management_screen.dart: _createNewAccount() Ed25519 fallback
  now blocked on mainnet with clear error message
- Total Ed25519 gates: 5 (generate, import, sign, derive, create-account)

AUDIT RESULTS (272 tests passed, 0 failed, 3 ignored):
- Zero bare unwrap() in production code
- Zero stale hardcoded timestamps in production code
- Zero unguarded Ed25519 paths on mainnet builds
- Genesis config integrity verified (supply, dev alloc, network_id, secrets)
- flutter_validator: PASS (Tor enforcement, Ed25519 gating, peer discovery)
- flutter_wallet: PASS (all 5 Ed25519 gates, clipboard auto-clear, secrets)

Files changed: 4 (lib.rs, main.rs, wallet_service.dart, account_management_screen.dart)
