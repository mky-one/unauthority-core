security: full mainnet audit M-6 - strip genesis secrets, enforce Tor, harden Flutter apps

M-6 Audit Fixes:
- G-1 CRITICAL: Strip all private_key + seed_phrase from 4 genesis files (48 fields)
- T-1 HIGH: Mainnet refuses startup without Tor (LOS_SOCKS5_PROXY required)
- R-2 MEDIUM: Block LOS_BIND_ALL=1 on mainnet builds
- N-2 MEDIUM: Fix testnet genesis network_id from 1 to 2
- S-03 HIGH: Replace 400+ debugPrint with losLog() (no-op in release mode)
- D-1/D-2: Docker testnet-genesis stripping via jq
- Clipboard auto-clear 30s on wallet_setup_screen
- Validator standalone mode gate on mainnet (refuse without Tor)

Rust: 0 warnings, 294 tests passing
Flutter: 0 analysis issues, all tests passing
