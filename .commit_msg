security: M-7 - stdin secrets, deterministic VM, Ed25519 gate

S-01 HIGH: Move LOS_SEED_PHRASE + LOS_WALLET_PASSWORD from env vars
to stdin pipe protocol. Prevents /proc/[pid]/environ exposure on Linux.
- Rust: read 2 lines from stdin when piped (wallet_pw, seed_phrase)
- Flutter: write both secrets to stdin, remove LOS_SEED_PHRASE from env
- Fallback to env vars when stdin is a TTY (interactive CLI usage)

VM-01 MEDIUM: Deterministic contract execution timestamp.
- Add block_timestamp field to ContractCall (serde default = 0)
- try_hosted_call() uses block.timestamp instead of SystemTime::now()
- Both REST handler and P2P replication pass block.timestamp
- Prevents non-deterministic WASM execution across validators

Ed25519: Added compile-time documentation on tree-shaking behavior.
Ed25519 fallback is properly gated (throws on mainnet builds).

Tests: 294 Rust passed, 0 failed | Flutter: 0 issues, all tests passed
