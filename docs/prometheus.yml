# FIX C12-02: Proper Prometheus server configuration.
# Previously, only the alerts file was mounted as prometheus.yml,
# which caused Prometheus to refuse to start (missing scrape_configs).

global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
  evaluation_interval: 15s

# Alert rules (loaded from separate file)
rule_files:
  - /etc/prometheus/alerts.yml

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'uat-validators'
    static_configs:
      - targets:
          - 'validator-1:9090'
          - 'validator-2:9090'
          - 'validator-3:9090'
          - 'validator-4:9090'
        labels:
          network: 'testnet'

  - job_name: 'prometheus'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9090']
